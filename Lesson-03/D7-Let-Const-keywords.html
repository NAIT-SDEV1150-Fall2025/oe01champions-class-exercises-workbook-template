    <h2>This section tells us about LET and CONST keywords used to declare the variables.</h2>
    <h3>LET keyword <br>Variables declared with LET have Block Scope, and Variables declared with LET cannot be Redeclared in the same scope</h3>


    <p>This is an example that is showing the block scope of LET keyword <span id="letscope"></span></p>

    </div>

    <div>
       <h3>CONST keyword <br>CONSTANTS declared with CONST have Block Scope, and CONSTANTS declared with CONST cannot be Redeclared as well as REASSIGNED in the same scope</h3> 
        <p>This is an example of CONSTANTS (<span id="constant-1"></span>)</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed. <b>i.e. reference of element should not change.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>Use const when you declare:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A new array (Array Reference: Base address and indexing): An array is a type of object, which allows you to store multiple values. They are a bit like lists(Lists of values).</li>
            <li>Objects (Key and values)</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Array</b>
        <p>Arrays can hold any type of variable. The values of the array won't be converted to a single data type or anything like that. JavaScript simply stores all the variables with their own data type and value in the array.</p>
        <p>Arrays are zero-indexed. So, the positional value of the last element in the array will be one lesser than the total number of elements.</p>
        <p>Arrays have a very useful built-in property: <b>length.</b> This will return the number of values that the array has:</p>

        <p> Lets count and get all main elements of this course and those are: <b><span id="array-reference"></span></b></p>
        </div>

    <div>
        <p> Lets change the elements of array to demonstrate that CONST ARRAY REFERENCE: <b><span id="change-array"></span></b></p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <b>Objects</b>
        <p>An object is a chance to group multiple variables into one. This is done with curly brackets: { and }. Objects can have multiple KEYS(Properties) and relevant values.</p>
        <p> Lets see how objects can be defined and used using ARRAY to demonstrate that CONST ARRAY REFERENCE:

        Lets get all course details here:  <b><span id="object-array"></span></b></p>
