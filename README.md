4. Open the provided development server URL in your browser
5. You should see the default render for the vite project.
6. Use this as the base for today's examples.

## ESLint

This exercise project has been configured to use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). From the website:

> ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. It is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.

We will make use of ESLint, with the provided configuration, to ensure we are writing clean and consistent JavaScript. Your instructor will walk you through the necessary steps to configure your editor to make use of ESLint as you write your own code.

## Instructor Demo and Student Exercise

Complete the demo along with your instructor and then attempt the exercise prompts (see the comments in the `main.js` file).

## Push to your GitHub workbook repo

Once you've made any updates to the project, stage your files, commit your work, and push to the remote repository.

1. Open a terminal in VS Code
2. Stage all updated and created files:
```sh
git add .
```
1. Commit the changes:
```sh
git commit -m 'Lesson 03 Example'
